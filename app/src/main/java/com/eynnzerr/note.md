I met some trouble when using AndroidView. For some necessary reason, I have to use EditText in Jetpack Compose so I use AndroidView to wrap it up. If I input a string to the editText, of course it will request focus and wake up softInput. Then if I get back to the last screen via jetpack navigation while softInput is still present, it will not disappear after leaving current screen. I tried using `LocalSoftwareKeyboardController.current.hide()` , but it doesn't work. Seems that **LocalSoftwareKeyboardController can't take control of the softInput keyboard if it's an AndroidView who received focus and called softInput**?
So next I turned to traditional way, i.e. `InputMethodManager`, but it requires the windowToken of the view, which is hard to obtain in Compose, since I have no access to the    instance of the editText outside of AndroidView. I tried saving the reference to the editText inside AndroidView factory even though it's unreasonable in Compose, and it failed with null pointer exception. I also think about using window/decor's windowToken instead, but that means I have to pass it through from the top activity to Composables, and I do not hope to do so. Is there any other way I haven't think of to solve this problem?
